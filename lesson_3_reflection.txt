When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?

    I would use a remote repository when I want to work with other people or when
    I want to acces my data from different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    ..., so I have better control of what is uploaded on GitHub and which files arent

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

    Forks are only available on GitHub. I can create a fork to clone a repository from
    another user to my account. So they are only available online on GitHub.
    Clones give me the opportunity to get a repository, saved on GitHub, to my pc.
    Branches are parts of a git repository to manage different version branches. They
    are also available on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    I know in which commits my master branch is different from the remote branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and 
what would be harder?

    I don't know how I would collaborate without Git and GitHub, because its the
    easiest way.
