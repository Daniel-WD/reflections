What happens when you initialize a repository? 
Why do you need to do it?

    When I initialize a Git repository, a hidden 
    .git file will be created and its necessary 
    to save meta-data for Git.

How is the staging area different from the 
working directory and the repository? What
value do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains the files, which
    should be commited in the future in the
    repository. These files were chosen from the
    working directory.
    So the repository contains the commits for the
    files in the staging area and you can choose
    these files from the working directory.
    This concept let's you the freedom to choose, 
    which files to commit in the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you 
have one commit per logical change?

    I can compare the staging area with the working
    directory, so I can see what changed. Then I can
    choice what I want to commit for each logical
    change.
